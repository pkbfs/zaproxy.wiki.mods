# [FAQ:](FAQtoplevel) How do you configure ZAP to test an application on localhost?

ZAP has no problems scanning applications running on localhost, however there are a couple of things you need to be aware of.

By default ZAP listens on port 8080. If your app also listens on 8080 then you'll need to change one of them to listen on a different port - its probably easier to change ZAP using the [Options Local Proxies](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki/HelpUiDialogsOptionsLocalproxy) screen, remember to change your browser's proxy settings as well: [Configuring Proxies](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki/HelpStartProxies).

You also need to check that you have not configured your browser to ignore your configured proxy (ZAP) for localhost.
